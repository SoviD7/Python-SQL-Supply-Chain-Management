# Python-SQL-Supply-Chain-Management
### 1. Project Overview 
The supply chain dataset comprises 24 columns and 100+ rows, containing information on various aspects of the supply chain, including product details, pricing, availability, sales, manufacturing, shipping, and costs. Aim is to get insights for better business performance. It is designed for analyzing revenue generation, manufacturing expenses, and transportation costs to optimize supply chain operations.

### 2. Problem Statement
The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, manufacturing, and logistics. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the data to optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

### 3. Python Analysis
#### Sales Analysis:
1️. Analyze the number of products sold and revenue generated to understand sales performance over time.<br>
2️. Identify customer demographics to determine which groups are purchasing the most products.<br>
3️. Track availability and stock levels to ensure the right products are in stock when customers are ready to buy.<be>

#### Operational Analysis:
1️. Analyze lead times, order quantities, and production volumes to optimize inventory management and reduce stockouts.<br>
2️. Track manufacturing lead times and costs to identify areas for improvement and cost savings.<br>
3️. Monitor inspection results and defect rates to identify quality issues and improve manufacturing processes.<be>

#### Shipping Analysis:
1️. Analyze costs, transportation modes, and routes to optimize logistics and reduce shipping costs.<br>
2️. Monitor shipping times, shipping carriers, and modes of transportation to ensure timely delivery to customers.<br>
3️. Track shipping costs associated with shipping carriers and revenue generated to identify areas for cost savings.<be>

### 4. Mysql Analysis
I used MySQL to analyze supply chain data and answer specific questions.<br>

1. Total Revenue by Product Type: Calculate the total revenue generated by each product type. This can help identify the most profitable products.<br>
2. Shipping Costs by Carrier: Calculate the average shipping costs for each shipping carrier to evaluate which carrier is the most cost-effective.<br>
3. Lead Times by Supplier: Calculate average lead times for each supplier to assess their reliability in delivering products on time.<br>
4. Total Products Sold by Location: Determine the total number of products sold in each location to understand regional demand.<br>
5. Defect Rates by Inspection Results: Calculate defect rates for different inspection results to assess product quality.<br>
6. Ranking Products by Profitability: Write a query to rank products based on profitability, where profitability is calculated as (revenue generated - manufacturing costs - shipping costs).<br>
7. Supplier Performance Analysis: Calculate the average lead time for each supplier and identify suppliers with lead times higher than the overall average.<br>
8. Top 5 Shipping Carriers by Cost Efficiency: Determine the top 5 shipping carriers with the lowest average shipping costs per product shipped.<be>

### 5. Insights
1. The highest number of products sold among the three product categories is skincare, which accounts for 45% of the business. Haircare follows at 29%, and cosmetics contribute 25% to the revenue.<br>
2. Analyzing customer demographics versus the number of products sold by product type reveals that the female group purchases higher-quality skincare and cosmetic products, while the male group opts for products of roughly equal quality in terms of haircare and cosmetics.<br>
3. An unknown group category purchases a higher quantity of all three product types. Skincare products are the most popular among all four product categories, indicating a high demand.<br>
4. Analyzing product availability and stock levels shows that the company maintains an equal quantity of inventory for haircare and skincare products, with slightly less stock for cosmetics. Skincare products exhibit higher availability and lower stock levels, enabling quick manufacturing and shipment.<br>
5. In contrast, cosmetics and haircare have higher stock levels and lower availability, meaning the company faces challenges in promptly shipping these products due to longer manufacturing times.<br>
6. Skincare products have higher order quantities and longer lead times, often associated with higher production volumes.<br>
7. Higher production volumes necessitate longer lead times to ensure adequate time for manufacturing products to meet customer demand.<br>
8. Haircare products also exhibit longer lead times and higher production volumes, possibly due to the need for more specialized ingredients or manufacturing processes.<br>
9. All product categories show a higher defect rate.<br>
10. An analysis of revenue generated by shipping carriers indicates that shipping carrier B is costlier but generates higher revenue.<br>
11. According to the graph, the fastest and most efficient shipping option is Carrier B, and the most efficient transportation mode is road in all four transportation modes.<br>

### 6.Decisions to take

1. Strategic Inventory Management 
   - Allocate more resources to skincare products due to their high demand.
   - Optimize cosmetics and haircare manufacturing processes to reduce lead times and improve product availability.

2. **Targeted Marketing:**
   - Tailor marketing strategies to cater to the preferences of different customer demographics, emphasizing the quality of skincare and cosmetic products for the female group.

3. **Supply Chain Optimization:**
   - Invest in technologies or processes to reduce manufacturing lead times, particularly for cosmetics and haircare, to match the demand for timely shipments.

4. **Quality Control:**
   - Address the higher defect rates across all product categories by implementing stricter quality control measures in the manufacturing process.

5. **Shipping Cost Evaluation:**
   - Reevaluate the shipping carrier strategy, considering the balance between cost and revenue. Explore options to negotiate better rates or find more cost-effective carriers without compromising on timely deliveries.

6. **Transportation Mode Optimization:**
   - Focus on road transportation for its efficiency, but explore ways to optimize other modes based on specific scenarios.

7. **Customer Relationship Management:**
   - Enhance communication with customers, especially those in the unknown group category, to understand their needs better and improve customer satisfaction.

8. **Profitability Analysis:**
   - Continuously monitor and analyze the profitability of each product type and shipping carrier. Adjust strategies based on the financial performance of products and carriers.

9. **Investment in Skincare Products:**
   - Given the high revenue contribution from skincare products, consider allocating additional resources, marketing efforts, and innovations to further boost this category's performance.

These decisions should be made in consideration of the company's overall goals, resources, and long-term strategy. Regular monitoring and adjustment based on performance metrics will be crucial to maintaining a responsive and optimized supply chain.
